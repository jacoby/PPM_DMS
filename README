This is a tool to allow multiple users to add tweets to one twitter
account using direct messages.

read_twitter_dms.pl checks the direct messages to a given
twitter account. If those tweets are from a given twitter
user, it then saves those DMs to a database. This action
is set at a regular interval, via something like crontab.

write_twitter_dms.pl takes the oldest unread tweet from 
the database, marks it read, then tweets it. This allows
you to fill the database at your convenience, then tweet 
at regular intervals when you want them to. This is also
done via crontab.
